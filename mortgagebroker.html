    <h1> WHY CONSULT A MORTGAGE ADVISOR </h1>

    <p> Mortgage advisors are essential in order to help the client develop a firm understanding of different types of
        mortgage loans available, financial institutions to consider getting a mortgage loan from, setting up down
        payment price for the property, and how in turn it will affect the length of the contract with the continuously
        changing tax/interest rates.  This further gives the client an upper hand while negotiating mortgage terms
        with the lending institution and essentially understand each and every mortgage term put forth by the lender.
        <br><br>
        This further helps the client develop a clear and an acute understanding on the various pros and cons to
        weigh before setting up an amount for a mortgage loan lent from any financial institution further encompassing
        the continually fluctuating interest rates that could significantly have an affect on the initial total value
        of the property.
        <br><br>â€‹
        In order to help the clients currently under dealings or contracts with the firm itself including the first
        time home buyers/sellers, working with our firm's Realtors will get a significant discount on such premium
        consultations. This includes first free consultation and a significant discount if opted in for the
        second visit.
        <br><br>
        "As mortgage brokers, we're able to offer buyers the products of as many banks as we can handle, which gives
        them a broader product set," says Andrew Weinberg, principal at Silver Fin Capital. "A good mortgage broker
        anticipates hiccups before they occur. Our expertise is knowing what kinds of issues, like closing on time,
        will come up on loans that might make it not work at one lender, but may make it work at another."
